OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Main

Overview
========
OpenDaylight VTN provides multi-tenant virtual network functions on
OpenDaylight controllers. OpenDaylight VTN consists of two parts:
VTN Coordinator and VTN Manager.

VTN Coordinator orchestrates multiple VTN Managers running in OpenDaylight
Controllers, and provides VTN Applications with VTN API.

VTN Manager is OSGi bundles running in OpenDaylight Controller. Current
VTN Manager supports only OpenFlow switches. It handles PACKET_IN messages,
sends PACKET_OUT messages, manages host information, and installs flow entries
into OpenFlow switches to provide VTN Coordinator with virtual network
functions.

The requirements for installing these two are different.
Therefore, we recommend that you install VTN Manager and VTN Coordinator
in different machines.

VTN Coordinator Installation Guide
==================================
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Installation:VTN_Coordinator

== Installing VTN Coordinator from source code (My edit) ==

=== Prior preparation (OS and prerequisites) ===
 1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 or later on your machine

 2. Download and install Build-essential from apt

 3. Download and install Java 17 (JDK + JRE)

 4. Download and install PostgreSQL

 5. Download and install Maven (3.8.3+)

 6. Install Python 2

 7. Install gtest-devel and json-c libraries
      Note: if you're using a newer version of json-c library, edit /usr/include/json-c/json.h and add "#include <bits.h>" to avoid the error for implicit usage of "is_error"

=== Build ===
 1. Download the code from git.
        git clone ssh://git@github.com:kirazero17/odl_neo_vtn.git
          or

 2. Build and install VTN Coordinator.
        cd vtn/coordinator
        mvn -f dist/pom.xml package
        sudo make install

== Run VTN Coordinator (Everything below this emains from the orginal Instruction) ==
=== Prior preparation ===
 1. Install Tomcat.
    * Download the following file.
      http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.39/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz
    * Extract under /usr/share/java.
        tar zxvf apache-tomcat-7.0.39.tar.gz -C /usr/share/java

 2. Carry out Tomcat settings.
    * Create the following symbolic link.
        ln -s /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/webapps/vtn-webapi \
              /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/webapps/vtn-webapi

    * Add the following to "common.loader" of
      /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/catalina.properties.

        /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib,/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/lib/*.jar

    * Add the following to "shared.loader" of
      /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/catalina.properties.

        /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/shared/lib/*.jar

    * Add the following to <Server> of
      /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/conf/server.xml.

        <Listener className="org.opendaylight.vtn.tomcat.server.StateListener" />

 3. Set up the DB.
        /usr/local/vtn/sbin/db_setup

=== Start ===
 1. Start VTN Coordinator and Tomcat.
        /usr/local/vtn/bin/vtn_start
        /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/bin/catalina.sh start

 2. Execute the following commands while stopping.
        /usr/share/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/bin/catalina.sh stop
        /usr/local/vtn/bin/vtn_stop

=== WebAPI ===
 * VTN Coordinator version information will be displayed if following command
   is executed when VTN has started successfully.
        $ curl -X GET -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'username: admin' \
               -H 'password: adminpass' -H 'ipaddr:127.0.0.1' \
               http://127.0.0.1:8080/vtn-webapi/api_version.json

VTN Manager Installation Guide
==============================
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):Installation:VTN_Manager

== Installing VTN Manager from source code ==
=== Prior preparation ===
Prior preparation for installing VTN Manager is the same as OpenDaylight controller.
Please see Controller's Installation Guide.
    https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Installation

=== Build ===
The procedure that follows assumes that you are installing VTN Manager
on your local Linux machine.

 1. Download the code from the Git repository of VTN Project.
        git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/vtn.git
          or
        git clone https://github.com/kirazero17/odl_neo_vtn.git

The following instructions assume you put the VTN source code
in directory ${VTN_DIR}.
        ${VTN_DIR}=<Top of VTN source tree>

 2. Build the code of VTN Manager.
        cd ${VTN_DIR}
        mvn -f manager/pom.xml install
    some arguments:
    -Dcheckstyle.skip=true - Skip checkstyle
    -U - Fix dependencies

== Run the Controller with VTN Manager ==
On Linux/Unix systems, execute run.sh in the installation directory of
OpenDaylight Controller.
The installation directory is usually
${VTN_DIR}/manager/dist/target/distribution.vtn-manager-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight.

        cd ${VTN_DIR}/manager/dist/target/distribution.vtn-manager-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
        ./run.sh

Please see Controller's Installation Guide for more information.
    https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Installation

=== REST API ===
VTN Manager provides REST API for virtual network functions.

Please check the VTN Manager's REST API specification page for detailed information.
    https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Manager:RestApi

Here is an example of how to create a virtual tenant network.

        curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Accept: application/json" -H \
        "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
        http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/vtn/default/vtns/Tenant1 \
        -d '{"description": "My First Virtual Tenant Network"}'

You can check the list of all tenants by executing the following command.

        curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Accept: application/json" -H \
        "Content-type: application/json" -X GET \
        http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/vtn/default/vtns
